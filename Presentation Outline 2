Favorite Theorem: (Cauchy's) Argument Principle

1. Background:
-Theorem dates back to the 19th century and has its roots in complex analysis.
-One major result of complex analysis is the ability to evaluate line integrals in the real plane by taking them to the complex plane.

2. Connection to me:
-I personally find doing computations in the complex plane fun.
-In high school (and perhaps even in college) we're told it's increasingly difficult if not downright impossible to find the roots of 
polynomialsexceeding degree 3. While the argument principle does not necessarily find every root, it allows us to determine the general
location of roots.

3. Introduce the Residue Theorem.

4. Introduce the Argument Principle and an abreviated proof.

5. Example applying the argument principle on a polynomial.

6. Real World Applications:
-One application of the argument principle in in determining the stability of dynamic systems, especially functions modeling 
time-dependance of a point in geometrical space.
