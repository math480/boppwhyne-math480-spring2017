"Why have I chosen Mathematical major? What do I love about math? What is math good for?"

Introduction:
-Student at UH
-Currently worked as a tutor at J.B. Castle High School. Have previously worked as a math tutor at WCC and UHM.
-I plan on either going into the Peace Corps or going to grad school after graduating. However, I have yet to look into grad schools and don’t know if I’d want to continue in mathematics. 
-Not too sure what I want to do with my degree. If I end up teaching I’d like to do it at a community college level, hence grad school. 

Why I Chose a Math Major:
-Though born and raised in Hawaii I started off my college career in Reno, Nevada, to get away from home. I was leaning towards a degree in Criminal Justice while I was there, and though I liked the school itself, I had a poor experience with the people there and ultimately ended up coming back to Hawaii after my first year. Since UHM doesn’t have a Criminal Justice degree, I considered couple of other majors eventually deciding on math because it was always one of my strong points in K-12 and I really enjoyed my math classes and working as a math tutor.
-I also really wanted a major where I didn’t have to take a lot of chemistry. My grandpa was a chem professor at UHM for over 30 years but I sure suck at chemistry and it’s my least favorite of the sciences. 

What I love about Math:
-I really just like doing computations. I just enjoy playing around with formulas and equations like a puzzle and crunching numbers.
-I think proofs are cool and I occasionally enjoy doing them, but I really prefer doing computations to writing proofs. 

What Math is good for:
-Math certainly has its uses as “the language of the universe;” being used to model real world situations and what not.
-Honestly I’m not too knowledgeable on what the abstract and theoretical math is used for.
-However, I personally think one of mathematics’ best uses in the schools K-12. I think it’s sad that so many kids hate math and I really think it’s because the mentality of math in schools has devolved to simply training kids to be calculators. I personally think this is an absolutely terrible mindset to have, and I’ve seen it negatively impact the self-esteem of students and contribute towards their festering hatred of mathematics. I personally think what math is good for in K-12 (and in even higher levels of education) is teaching people how to be intuitive and developing problem solving skills.
